# Cordova Plugin for Salesforce Mobile SDK

The **Salesforce Mobile SDK Cordova Plugin** npm package allows users to interface their hybrid iOS and Android mobile applications with the [Salesforce Platform](http://www.salesforce.com/platform/overview/), leveraging [Salesforce Mobile SDK for iOS](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS) and [Salesforce Mobile SDK for Android](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Android).

## Getting Started

If you're new to mobile development or the force.com platform, you may want to start at the [Mobile SDK landing page](http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Mobile_SDK). This page offers a variety of resources to help you determine the best technology path for creating your app, as well as many guides and blog posts detailing how to work with Mobile SDK.

## Starting from scratch

If you are starting from scratch, we recommend you use our [**forcehybrid**]((https://npmjs.org/package/forcehybrid) command-line utility.

## Adding the plugin to your existing Cordova procject

If you already have a Cordova project, you can add the plugin to it by doing:
       cordova plugin add salesforcemobilesdk-cordovaplugin
